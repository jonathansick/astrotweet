astrotweet - Work with AstroBetter's Index of Tweeting Astronomers
==================================================================

This is a project to build on AstroBetter's index of tweeting astronomers.
Some things that we *will* eventually do include:

- building and updating a twitter list of astronomers
- machine-readable analytics of astronomy tweeters, including number of tweets or followers.

Installation
------------

Download the code and run `setup.py install`

You'll need the following third-party packages: `Cliff`, `requests` and `twitter`.

Commands
--------

`astrotweet` is built around the philosophy of subcommands, much like `git`. Here are the commands included in `astrotweet`.

- `astrotweet summary` -- will output a summary table of astrotweeters to the file astrotweeters.csv.
